        <i><strong>Pseudo-classes</strong></i> are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the <u>document tree</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code style="color: rebeccapurple; background-color: bisque;">:hover</code>, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the
        visible
        element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in <code style="color: green;background-color: bisque;">a:hover</code> or
        <code style="color: blue;"><b style="color: red;">#elementid</b>:hover</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a
        selection that
        may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter. <sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup> Note the distinction between the
        double-colon <s>notation</s> used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation used for pseudo-classes.
